# MagicMirror
MultiArch Testbuild for MagicMirror

When I started to test MagicMirror with the original Docker-Image (https://hub.docker.com/r/karsten13/magicmirror) it did not work for me on my Raspberry PI4

So I decided to try MultiArch-Compiling via Docker-Hub by myself.

After the compiling worked, I changed the initial Config a little bit, that you will get a working Server-Only Container right out of the box.
